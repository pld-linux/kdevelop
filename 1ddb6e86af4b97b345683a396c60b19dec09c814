- added `BuildConflicts: star'. gnutar (which belongs to star pkg) breaks
  builds:
   gnutar -cf gnu.tar -C ./gnu AUTHORS  COPYING \
   ChangeLog  INSTALL  NEWS  README  TODO
   No such file or directory. Cannot stat 'ChangeLog'.
   gnutar: No such file or directory. Cannot stat 'INSTALL'.
   [...]
   with gtar (tar pkg) everything goes OK.
